# Javanese Chess (Catur Jawa)

Javanese Chess, also known as Catur Jawa, is a traditional game that hails from Indonesia. This game is popular among many Indonesian communities, particularly on the island of Java. The game is played on a 3x3 grid board and can be enjoyed by two players.

Each player starts the game with three pieces, which are placed horizontally on the board. Players take turns moving one piece at a time, with the objective of arranging their pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the other player. A win can also be achieved horizontally as long as the horizontal arrangement is different from the initial position.

This repository contains a website implementation of the game, an AI that can play the game, and an analysis of the game. The website allows for players to play the game online and the AI allows for playing against the computer. The analysis will give an insight of the game and its strategy. The goal of this project is to provide an interactive and educational experience for players to learn and enjoy Javanese Chess.
